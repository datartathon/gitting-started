# gitting-started

Hi, and welcome to this brief introduction to the Git versioning system. 

As someone coming from a mechanical engineering background, my motivation for creating this resource from the fact that like most of us in this group, I have had a somewhat non-linear, non-traditional path to coding. My goal is to share what I've learned about how developers approach code management, and also talk about using GIT as not just a code management tool, but also an efficient approach to documentation and project management.


## A few things before we get started.


### `git` is a command line tool.

We've all dealt with command line tools in the past. As someone who grew up using Windows throughout my childhood, the strongest example I can think of is opening up MS-DOS (or Terminal) and navigating the present directory using commands like `cd`, `mkdir`, `dir`, etc.

The alternative to command-line tools are GUIs, i.e. Graphical User Interfaces. If these two (GUIs and command-line tools), were to come head to head in a contest, GUI would steal the show in the "user-friendliness" category, whereas commad line tools would come as victor in "automation" and "server-side deployment". This is why, I found out, developers prefer command line tools: all actions can be sequentially arranged through text-based commands, which makes automation a walk in the park.  

> For all R enthusiasts out there, r-base is a command line tool, and RStudio is a GUI that invokes r-base commands depending on user interaction.

### `git` solves a real problem.

My slides on the topic talks about this. I'll add a link to them soom.

### `git` has a lot of jargon.

I wouldn't say that `git` is beginner friendly. It comes with a lot of jargon such as `repository`, `cloning`, `pulling from master`, `diff`, `merge-request`. My approach to dealing with them is by making analogies, which I will briefly expand in a bit.   


### `git` is a concept, Gitlab, Github, BItBucket etc. are just implementations of the `git` concept.

`git` was introduced to the world by Linus Torvalds, the same guy that invented Linux. When I first learned about him, I really admired him for his a genius, he created an open source OS that changed the world, and then created a mechanism where thousands of people could collaborate. However, over the years it has come to light that [working with the guy is a nightmare](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/after-years-of-abusive-e-mails-the-creator-of-linux-steps-aside), and now I'm not sure how to feel about the guy anymore.


## Installing git
Since there are a wide variety of lessons already dedicated to this topic, I've decided to save some time and screen-space, by pointing you to tutorials on the topic:

* [Install Git on Mac OS X](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x)
* [Install Git on Windows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)
* [Install Git on Linux](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#linux)
