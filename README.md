# gitting-started

Hi, and welcome to this brief introduction to the Git versioning system. 

As someone coming from a mechanical engineering background, my motivation for creating this resource from the fact that like most of us in this group, I have had a somewhat non-linear, non-traditional path to coding. My goal is to shed share what I've learned about how developers approach code management, and also talk about using GIT as not just a code management tool, but also an efficient approach to documentation and project management.


## A few things before we get started.


### `git` is a command line tool.

We've all dealt with command line tools in the past. As someone who grew up using Windows throughout my childhood, the strongest example I can think of is opening up MS-DOS (or Terminal) and navigating the present directory using commands like `cd`, `mkdir`, `dir`, etc.

### `git` helps facilitate collaboration among coders.

### `git` has a lot of jargon.

I wouldn't say that `git` is beginner friendly. It comes with a lot of jargon such as `repository`, `cloning`, `pulling from master`, `diff`, `merge-request`. My approach to dealing with them is by making analogies, which I will briefly expand in a bit.   


### `git` is a concept, Gitlab, Github, BItBucket etc. are just implementations of the `git` concept.

`git` was introduced to the world by Linus Torvalds, the same guy that invented Linux. When I first learned about him, I really admired him for his a genius, he created an open source OS that changed the world, and then created a mechanism where thousands of people could collaborate. However, over the years it has come to light that [working with the guy is a nightmare](https://www.newyorker.com/science/elements/after-years-of-abusive-e-mails-the-creator-of-linux-steps-aside), and now I'm not sure how to feel about the guy anymore.
